# The Project

This is a project using Jasmine to test existing code that was provided by Udacity.  


## How to view this project

Please download the files from Github. Once you have them on your computer go ahead and open the index.html to see what the finished poject looks like. Good. Now, from the main project folder open the 'jasmine' folder. Next open the 'spec' folder. In this folder please open the 'feedreader.js' file. This has all the jasmine tests on it that I wrote. If you would like to see the code that is being tested please go back to the main project folder, then open the 'js' folder, and within that folder open the file 'app.js.' This is the code provided to the students that we wrote the tests against. 


## See the results

If you don't want to look at the code, you can just scroll to the bottom of the index.html page in your browswer and see the descriptions of the jasmine tests and their results. A big thanks to Udacity for teaching us this!
